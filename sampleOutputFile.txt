Please enter the name of a text file to retrieve your graph from: 
   1) Read in a new graph
   2) Print out the graph
   3) Topological Sort
   4) Shortest Path (from a node of your choice to all other nodes)
   5) Minimum Spanning Tree
   6) Exit the program

Please enter your choice: This graph cannot be topologically sorted.
